## About Dashboards

Dashboards allow you to combine charts and key metrics in a single view. Use filters to focus on the data that matters and create widgets that track your own KPIs.

## Creating a dashboard

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New dashboard** and choose a name.
3. Add widgets such as charts or KPI counters using the **Add widget** button.
4. Configure filters to refine the data shown in each widget.

Dashboards are saved to your workspace so every team member can access them.
